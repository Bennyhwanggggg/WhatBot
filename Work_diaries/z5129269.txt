Week1:
We set up the group, we had one face-to-face meeting and online meeting.
We had an idea that we would do a student-tutor system.
I prepared for technical depth and its scale of the system

Week2:
Review for the frontend demo, and having a brainstorm with members to fulfil the final proposal.
