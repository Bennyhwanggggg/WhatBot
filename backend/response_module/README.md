# Response Module
Response Module is responsible for formulating responses to user queries. Query Module will provide the intent 
and user message to Response Module so it has some information on how it can find the result user is asking 
for. Response Module also uses the Utility Module in some situations to perform the task if required.

## Features

in our database to get the information user is searching for.
